# Ledits_Batch_Script
A script created to enable the LEDITS model to apply concepts in batch; this was absent in the default gradio file

It is pretty barebones for now and only implements the 1st concept to all files using a list of concepts extracted from a text file.
Multiple concepts can be easily enabled with minor code tweaks in the last section of the file; same holds true for auto-captioning for the DDPM inversion (It has been disabled/commented out for now in this script).
